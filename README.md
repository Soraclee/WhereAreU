# **WhereAreU**
## **Always have R3nzSkin available**

WhereAreU is a simple program that checks whether R3nzSkin is still available and, if not, downloads and installs it. It then launches it. It will always use the latest version of R3nzSkin.

Why did we make this program? Simply because R3nzSkin isn't always available and I don't feel like downloading it manually every time. What's more, there's no automatic update system. So this program is there to make up for these problems.

Steps :
- Download the latest version of [WhereAreU](https://github.com/Soraclee/WhereAreU/releases/latest)
- Extract the WhereAreU.exe file into your League of Legends folder (not the Riot Client folder, the default is: C:\Riot GamesLeague of Legends)
- Create a shortcut to WhereAreU.exe on your desktop
- Ajouter R3nzSkin.exe, R3nzSkin.dll et le dossier Riot Games Ã  votre liste d'exceptions de votre antivirus, sinon votre antivirus risque de supprimer R3nzSkin.exe et R3nzSkin.dll
- Launch the shortcut
- Enjoy!
