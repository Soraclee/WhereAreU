# **WhereAreU**
## **Always have R3nzSkin available**

WhereAreU is a simple program that checks whether R3nzSkin is still available and, if not, downloads and installs it. It then launches it. It will always use the latest version of R3nzSkin.

Why did we make this program? Simply because R3nzSkin isn't always available and I don't feel like downloading it manually every time. What's more, there's no automatic update system. So this program is there to make up for these problems.

Steps :
- Download the latest version of [WhereAreU](https://github.com/Soraclee/WhereAreU/releases/latest)
- Extract WhereAreU into a folder anywhere you like, it's important to put it in a folder as it will create a settings file.
- Create a shortcut to WhereAreU.exe on your desktop
- Add R3nzSkin.exe, R3nzSkin.dll and the Riot Games folder to your antivirus exception list, otherwise your antivirus may delete R3nzSkin.exe and R3nzSkin.dll
- Launch the shortcut
- Enjoy!
