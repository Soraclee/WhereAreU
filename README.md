# **WhereAreU**
## **Always have R3nzSkin available**

WhereAreU is a simple program that checks whether R3nzSkin is still available and, if not, downloads and installs it. It then launches it. It will always use the latest version of R3nzSkin.

Why did we make this program? Simply because R3nzSkin isn't always available and I don't feel like downloading it manually every time. What's more, there's no automatic update system. So this program is there to make up for these problems.
